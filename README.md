To best go through the presentation, install the recommended extensions and configure VS Code to open md and mdx files in the preview window:

```
"workbench.editorAssociations": {
  "*.md": "vscode.markdown.preview.editor",
  "*.mdx": "vscode.markdown.preview.editor"
}
```

For the JS file, run it with Quokka:
```
Cmd-Shift-P > Quokka.js: Start on Current File
