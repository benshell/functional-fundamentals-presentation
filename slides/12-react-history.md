## React History

Early criticism of React was that it wasn't a full-fledged JS framework. It didn't have many of the things people expected from other frameworks like Angular, such as routing, services, an HTTP client, or even global state/events.

When React was introduced, the idea that the entire component tree would re-render for any change was a largely unknown concept that sounded crazy to most of us invested in traditional JavaScript development with Angular, jQuery, and earlier frameworks. But it's a concept that comes directly from functional programming. React introduced most of us to the concept that rendering UI was a mathematical computation.

Even today, the page title for reactjs.org says "React â€“ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces".
