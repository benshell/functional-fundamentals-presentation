## React State

State IS often necessary.

Try to group state together, having some components that contain state and others that don't. In React architecture, this concept can be called:

- Stateful vs stateless components
- Container vs presentational components
- Smart vs dumb components

We try and "lift state" to a higher level so that lower level components can be simple stateless components

Stateless components are easily to test and easier to optimize for performance.
(That's another presentation!)
