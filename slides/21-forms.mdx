## Forms in React

Interactions--like forms--can be handled as changes
to the inputs of the computation. A common pattern
is to treat a form component as "semi-stateless" from
the outside perspective, where a form is rendered based
on the given props, unless the user changes something
(and then the internal state is used).

```js
const Form = ({ initalState, onSubmit }) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialState)

  useEffect(() => {
    setValue(initalState)
  }, [initialState])

  const handleChangeText = (val) => {
    setValue(val)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter your name"
        value={value}
        onChangeText={handleChangeText}
      />
      <Button title="Submit" onPress={() => onSubmit(value)} />
    </>
  )
}
```
