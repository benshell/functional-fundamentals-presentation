## Pure

A pure function is a function where the return value is only determined
by its input values. (i.e. it is a black box)

- Math.sin(x)

- const greeting = (name) => `Hello ${name}!`

But if this component returns different output based on the time of day,
e.g. "Good morning, World", it is NOT pure:

```js
const greeting = (name) => {
  const hour = new Date().getHours()
  const greeting =
    hour > 0 && hour < 12 ? "morning" : hour >= 18 ? "evening" : "afternoon"
  return `Good ${greeting} ${name}!`
}
```
