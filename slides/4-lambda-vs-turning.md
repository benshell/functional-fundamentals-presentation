## Lambda Calculus vs Turing Machines

- Turing Machines capture a basic state based model of computation.
- Lambda Calculus captures a basic functional notion of computation.

These two quite different notions--one functional, one state-based, turn out to be equivalent.

This is known as the Church-Turing hypothesis (or part of the Church-Turing hypothesis)

The takeaway here is that there are different approaches to programming (computation) that emerged a long time ago, and still affect our work today.
