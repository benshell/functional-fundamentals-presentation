## React Router takes a functional approach to navigation

- Everything is a component (i.e. a function)
  (Remember our Lambda takeaway: even logical operations are just functions)

- Just like our Lambda examples of TRUE and NOT_TRUE
  which each take in two values and return one of them, components like <Router> take in:

  1. Active route (via React Context from <Routes>)
  2. Matching route
  3. Component to render
  
```
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="store" element={<Store />} />
  </Routes>
```
Each Route component (function) decides what to render, i.e. the Home component, or null.
It's just like the Lambda function TRUE returns the first argument,
while NOT_TRUE returns the the second argument.

Note that it's possible for more than one route to match.

Also note that we are not using flow control operators like `if`, `else`, etc.
