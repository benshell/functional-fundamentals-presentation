## Elements of Lambda Calculus

Lambda Calculus provides just three fundamental constructs:

1. VARIABLES, e.g. x
2. FUNCTIONS, e.g. λx.x
3. APPLICATIONS, e.g. (λx.x)a

It does NOT provide:

- Any built-in data types (numbers, strings, booleans, or any non-function datatype)

- In the strictest sense, even arithmetic expressions and basic numerals are defined with the constructs above. (Look up "Church encoding" for more on the later.)
